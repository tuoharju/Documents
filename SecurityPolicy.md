# Flo Apps Security Policy

All data handled by Flo Apps Ltd is managed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; EU 2016/679).

We use data to provide services to our clients and to maintain our Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Flo Apps will keep client data as long as is required to fulfil these purposes, or as long as Flo Apps is obliged to do so in accordance with prevailing legislation.

Data that is shared with a third party will only be used in accordance with the purposes set forth in this Security Policy.

Should Flo Apps be subject to reorganisation, merger or sale, Flo Apps may transmit personal data to the relative third party, provided that such third party undertakes to handle the personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Flo Apps has taken technical and organisational measures to protect data from loss, manipulation or unauthorised access. Flo Apps adapts its security measures in accordance with progress and development of the relevant technical area.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) protects rights of EU citizens. We regularly review and update our agreements, internal processes, procedures, data systems, and documentation to ensure we are in compliance with the GDPR regulations.

Under the GDPR regulations, customers have extended rights on how services manage their data, such as the right to rectification, access, and portability of the data as well as the right to be forgotten.

# Data in CRM, project management, and emailing lists

We store clients' basic contact details in [FloMembers](https://flomembers.fi).

We are using FrontApp, based in the United States, to handle some of the email traffic and client communication. FrontApp has completed the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certifications and we have signed an EU Data Processing Addendum with them. See https://community.frontapp.com/t/x1p4mw/is-front-compliant-with-gdpr for more information.

For project management, we use [Freedcamp](https://freedcamp.com), based in the United States.

To maintain email lists of our current and past clients, as well as potential future clients, we use Mailchimp whose servers may be located outside the EEA. Mailchimp has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and we have signed a Customer EU Data Processing Addendum with them. See https://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-the-general-data-protection-regulation

# Security-related data

Our systems save such security-related data as logins and IP addresses. This data is deleted programmatically after a delay.

# Clients' data

Data owned by clients is stored exclusively within the European Economic Area (EEA) with these exceptions:

* during email transmissions, recipients' email addresses and email content may be handled outside the EEA
* backups for Edge server are kept on Dropbox whose data centers are in the United States

By using FloMembers membership management, FloRoyalties royalty management and / or bespoke database systems to keep personal data, client agrees that Flo Apps Ltd may manage client's data over the course of the agreement and beyond, until the end of the backups' life cycle.

While clients make the final decisions about the data they collect, data saved in database systems provided by Flo Apps typically include

1. such personal data as persons' names and addresses
1. such categories as "members" and "subscribers"

## Data procedures

Data is handled as follows:

### When client transfers data to us

When we get data from a new client, that data is saved in:

 * HESK support system on `Linode Frankfurt` (cron removes the data after a timeout)
 * personal computers (crons should be used to clean Downloads etc)
 * encrypted TimeMachine backups
 * production server (cron cleans backups)
 * offsite backups

Client data may also be present in

 * personal emails (in case a client sends data by email **against** guidelines; it is every employee's duty that these attachments be deleted)
 * printouts (these must be deleted promptly)

### Live data and offsite backups

Flo Apps Ltd uses servers hosted by following service providers.

 * DigitalOcean (Amsterdam, NL; Frankfurt, DE)
   * see https://www.digitalocean.com/security/
   * offsite FloMembers backups are kept on Dropbox (see https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/general-data-protection-regulation) and mirrored back to Flo Apps DPO's computer
   * offsite WordPress backups are kept on [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/) and on Dropbox

 * Linode (Frankfurt, DE; London, UK)
   * see https://www.linode.com/compliance
   * offsite WordPress backups are kept on [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/) and on Dropbox

 * Shellit.org (Ulvila, FI)
   * see https://tavu.io/en/features
   * offsite FloMembers backups are kept on UpCloud Helsinki

 * UpCloud (Helsinki, FI)
   * see https://www.upcloud.com/documentation/faq/
   * FI-HEL2 is located at Telia Helsinki Data Center with ISO 27001 certification for security standards
   * offsite FloMembers backups are kept on UpCloud Helsinki

### FloMembers backups

Each live FloMembers server creates nightly backups of the data. These backups are also copied to an offsite server, in order to provide redundancy.

We keep daily, weekly and monthly backups on each live server. Restoring from backups is tested frequently.

### Closing an installation

If a FloMembers installation is closed, remaining backups are removed gradually over a period of 12 months. In the event client wants to transfer their data from one system to another, data can be downloaded in MS Excel format. In some services this may require Flo Apps' assistance.
 
## Server Level Security

We protect servers in following ways:

 1. Operating systems and server software are updated regularly. 
 1. We periodically run automated software to scan server security.
 1. Server-wide firewalls are in place to regulate network traffic.
 1. Logs are kept for an extended period of time.
 1. We are using [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) for server hardening.
 1. We are using Apache's `mod_security` module (web application firewall) on Edge server.
 1. We are using Apache's `mod_evasive` module (application layer module) on Edge server to protect against DoS attacks.
 1. Servers are overwritten before shutting them down when we migrate to new servers.

Services that are running on servers can be listed (`systemctl list-units --type service`) to make sure only necessary ones are running.

### Databases

Databases can not be accessed externally and only SSH key login is allowed.

On Ubuntu servers, MySQL security is enforced using `sudo mysql_secure_installation`. It can also be used to change `root` password for MySQL installation.

### Public Key Infrastructure

We use SSH keys to login to servers. Password login to servers is blocked.

SSH keys are also used in communication between GitHub repositories and the installations.

## Application Level Security (Generic)

### Client passwords

All passwords that system stores are saved using one-way hashing mechanisms. Flo Apps staff cannot view them. If a user loses their password, it cannot be retrieved â€” it must be reset.

### Logs

We keep a number of different logs on different levels. Some of these logs are cleaned automatically after a certain delay, some of them are kept permanently for security reasons. If a person has been removed permanently, their actions cannot be tracked down to the person after a certain delay. Anonymous data may still remain.

### SSL/TLS encryption

Backend applications' network traffic is encrypted with SSL.

## Application Level Security (FloMembers)

### Audit trail

Changes made to persons' data can be traced by user and date.

### Data downloads

Downloads are recorded in each installation and can be traced by user and date.

### Logins

All logins are written into a log. Login pages have brute force protection. System enforces medium password strength.

### Vulnerability scanners

We use two vulnerability scanners:

1. [Detectify](https://detectify.com/) runs automated vulnerability tests once a week.
1. [Intruder](https://www.intruder.io/) runs a full scan once a month and ad hoc tests whenever new threats emerge.

## Third-party integrations

When available, we use two-factor authentication to log into third party services.

### Bank transactions

Files that are fetched from banks are kept on our servers for 70 days (on `Core`, 180 days) and deleted via CRON operation.

### Facebook

FloMembers users can use their Facebook id's to log in.

### GatewayAPI

We deliver SMS's via [GatewayAPI](https://gatewayapi.com/). They store the SMS messages for 30 days to display logs of sent messages.

The processing includes the following data about data subjects:

* telephone number
* message content
* sending organization

### Google

#### Ads

For FloMembers Mini clients, we're using Google AdSense to show ads.

#### Analytics

We're using Google Analytics to

1. gather overall statistics of services' usage
1. to monitor and compare site loading times

#### Login

FloMembers users can use their Google credentials to log in.

### Mandrill

We use Mandrill (part of Mailchimp) to deliver email. Full content of the messages is kept on Mandrill servers for 3 days, detailed information about sent messages for 30 days and bounced data for 90 days.

Mailchimp Terms of Use and Privacy Policy cover how Mailchimp manages and handles data and what commitments they make in terms of data. Additionally, the [Mailchimp Security page](http://mailchimp.com/about/security) contains information relevant for both Mandrill and Mailchimp.

Mailchimp has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and we have signed a Customer EU Data Processing Addendum with them.

Mandrill's infrastructure is composed of three key components:

1) Relay servers, which accept mail from users through the API or SMTP integration
2) Application servers, which process and handle everything required for sending and storing data, and
3) Sending servers, which handle the actual delivery of emails to recipient servers

The relay servers (1) are located around the world in various Amazon-hosted regions to reduce latency.

The application servers (2) are also currently hosted via Amazon and are located in the US-West region of the United States.

The delivery servers (3) are also located in the United States and are a combination of hosted servers and ones that are managed by Mandrill in a secure facility.

Amazon AWS Identity and Access Management is used for authentication to AWS-related resources. Data may be accessed from Mandrill offices, but is generally not stored there except when transiently stored on individual machines.

### Maventa

Invoice-related data is transferred to [Maventa](https://maventa.com/) when e-invoices are sent. Client can delete this data via Maventa panel.

### Paytrail

Our clients use [Paytrail](https://www.paytrail.com/) to handle online payments in FloMembers.

### Posti Group

Address data that is fetched from Posti is kept in a text file on our servers for approximately 3 months and deleted when the next address update batch is run.

### Postituspalvelu Navakka

We are using [Postituspalvelu Navakka](https://www.postituspalvelunavakka.fi/) to send letters by post. We have signed a Data Processing Agreement with them.
